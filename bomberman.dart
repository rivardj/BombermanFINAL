/**TODO : Adapt the methods for more than 2 players.

 There seems to be a problem when getting/setting bool from class.list[i].bool.
 We used int of 0 and 1 instead of bool where necessary to fix the issue temporarily. 
 All the int that acts as bool have been protected with appropriate exception handling.*/
